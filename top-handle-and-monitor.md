Top handle and monitor
======================

This page discusses my thinking behind choosing a top handle and external monitor for video shooting with a DSLR.

TLDR; 
-----

Cheapest reasonable quality configuration:

* [UURig R005 cold shoe top handle](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1483011-REG/uurig_1365_aluminum_dslr_camera_universal.html).
* [FeelWorld FW759 7" monitor](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1234190-REG/feelworld_fw759_7_ips_1280_x.html).

Both links there are for B&H - you can also get these parts slightly cheaper on AliExpress (from their respective stores [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33000498271.html) and [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32901094485.html)).

The SmallRig equivalent of the UURig cold shoe top handle is the considerably more expensive [2094C](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1653061-REG/smallrig_2094c_universal_top_handle_with.html) (at $50 vs $20 for the UURig handle).

More expensive cage-based configuration:

* [SmallRig 1584 VersaFrame Cage (Medium)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1421833-REG/smallrig_1584_versaframe_cage.html) (check the dimensions against your camera first to confirm it will fit).
* [SmallRig 2048B top handle with small NATO rail](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1422088-REG/smallrig_2084_quick_release_nato_handle.html)
* [SmallRig tilt-only monitor mount]([two-bolt mount](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1582517-REG/smallrig_2904_swivel_and_tilt_adjustable.html)
* The FW759 already linked to above.

Note: this page just covers universal cages, SmallRig and others produce more compact cages for many current models. If you're OK with a cage that's tied to a specific camera model (it'll have a very good stable fit but little resale value if you switch camera) then you may be able to find one for your model e.g. [here](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/Hand-Shoulder-Waist-Stabilizers/ci/3925) on B&H.

Top handle vs side handles
--------------------------

Initially, I thought I wanted at least one handle (for the side of the camera that isn't designed to be gripped) to make holding the camera easier while filming video.

However, after various experiments, I found it's actually very difficult to hold the camera level (left to right). It sounds easy but any slight mismatch, that's not really noticeable to you, when holding the camera, or via the camera's own LCD monitor, ruins the shot with everything slightly off to one side.

Clearly, many people can get this down perfect and there are even spirit levels (like [these](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32826981213.html)) designed to help you hold the camera level (though how well they could work while moving is another question).

However, after watching (like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdrWf7mq9Qg) from Mark Bone called "Shoot Better Handheld"), I decided that a top handle sounded like a better alternative.

With a top handle the camera hangs from a handle that's either attached to the camera's hot shoe or to a cage that encloses the camera. The weight of the camera and lens keep the camera, suspended like this, keep the camera steadier - hopefully, steadier than is easily possible when gripping the camera with both hands from the side.

As with all approaches, it's still crucial to adjust your walking style to minimize the impact of your steps and provide the smoothest movement possible. Mark Bone discusses this briefly (in the video linked to above).

TODO: move the links here that already discuss how to walk smoothly.

If you're suspending the camera from a top handle then an external monitor also becomes necessary (as it'll be hard to adjust even the fold-out style built-in camera monitors to be easily visible when held from a top handle).

Cages
-----

There are many cage manufacturers but, as a geek, I found the lego-like composability of SmallRig parts attractive.

SmallRig have a number of sites, including (all with that, to me, unattractive style that seems typical of Chinese sites):

* [SmallRig Global](https://www.smallrig.com/)
* [SmallRig AliExpress Store](https://smallrig.aliexpress.com/)
* [SmallRig Germany](https://www.smallrig.com.de/)

But one of the most convenient places to buy their parts seems to the [B&H SmallRig Store](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/browse/smallrig-store/ci/48496).

A camera cage allows you to easily add components to your camera, e.g. a top handle or a monitor.

For many popular modern cameras there are model specific cages. But you can also buy universal cages:

* [SmallRig 1750 VersaFrame Cage (Large)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1421900-REG/smallrig_1750_versaframe_cage_large.html)
* [SmallRig 1584 VersaFrame Cage (Medium)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1421833-REG/smallrig_1584_versaframe_cage.html)

Unless you've got a particularly large camera, the medium cage is probably appropriate.

Attaching parts
---------------

There are various ways to attach parts to a cage - the most obvious being to buy parts that screw directly onto the cage.

However, for handles etc. it can be convenient to be able to quickly pop them on and off.

The most popular mechanism seems to be the [NATO Accessory Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Accessory_Rail) system (yes, it really was developed for NATO). Here you attach a rail, like [this](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1421802-REG/smallrig_1409_quick_release_safety_rail.html) or [this](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1430416-REG/smallrig_mini_quick_release_nato.html) (low-profile) to the cage and then attach parts, with the NATO quick release system, to these rails.

Handles
-------

There are no end of SmallRig top handles.

I would choose this [2048B top handle](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1422088-REG/smallrig_2084_quick_release_nato_handle.html) as it includes holes at the front for attaching a two-bolt monitor mount.

The 2048B comes with the necessary small NATO rail needed for attaching it to a cage. If you already have a rail, then the [2005 top handle](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1422032-REG/smallrig_2005_quick_release_nato_handle.html) is the same handle without the rail included.

Being able to take the monitor off with the quick-release handle sounds convenient (as described [here](https://youtu.be/jmh_y0VfiDY?t=316) by Chadwin Smith (3m 15s in to his video "What's The Best Top Handle for Your Camera Rig?").

Note: you can get what are called ARRI-style monitor mounts (like this [one](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1582516-REG/smallrig_2903_swivel_and_tilt_adjustable.html)) which use a single 1/4" bolt but many people seem to hate the mounts that can both swivel and tilt - even the best ones seem to have a tendency to flop, i.e. swivel, to the side at the worst possible times.

Note: 2048B/2005 seems to be the only top handle with the front facing 1/4" holes needed to attach the monitor mount that I like. I actually prefer the look of the metal handle and SmallRig seem to have produced a variant of this style with a metal handle but not anymore.

Monitor mount
-------------

Having a monitor mount that can both tilt and swivel seems ideal but, as already noted, I came across no end of videos cursing their tendency to come lose and flop sideways.

If you think you can cope with this (i.e. tighten things sufficiently) then you get much more flexibility with the handle you can choose, e.g. you can use something like this [tilt and swivel mount](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1582516-REG/smallrig_2903_swivel_and_tilt_adjustable.html) which uses the ARRI-style mount that works with nearly all handles (the cold-shoe style also works with most handles).

However, if you go for a tilt only mount then you're effectively limited to this [two-bolt mount](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1582517-REG/smallrig_2904_swivel_and_tilt_adjustable.html) which in turn dictates the handle you use (assuming you attach the mount to the top handle rather than the cage).

Monitor
-------

[FeelWorld](https://feelworld.ltd/) seems to dominate the market for low-end camera monitors.

Their current (late 2021) best-seller in the sub US$100 segment is the FW759 - available [here](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1234190-REG/feelworld_fw759_7_ips_1280_x.html) from B&H and [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32901094485.html) from the FeelWorld AliExpress Store (on the AliExpress page, they also link to a slightly cheaper unbranded version of the same monitor).

Monitor models change more quickly than handles etc. so just look for the current most popular monitor in your price range in the monitor section of the [B&H Store](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/On-Camera-LCD-Monitors/ci/1984) or the [FeelWorld AliExpress Store](https://viss.aliexpress.com/store/group/4K-HDMI-Camera-Monitor/4425001_515472027.html).

Miscellaneous
-------------

Miscellaneous items on AliExpress:

* [UURig R043 side handle with L Plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002258394704.html) - Fr. 30.
* [Ulanzi dual grip minimal universal cage](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001758132070.html) - Fr. 16 (as the price suggests this isn't very substantial and the comments suggest that the cheap plastic handles won't cope with the weight of a DSLR).
* [Yelangu basic universal cage with top handle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003167082186.html) - Fr. 21.
* [Yelangu basic universal cage with side grips and top handle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003166662724.html) - Fr. 30.
* [Yelangu universal cage with top handle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003166517724.html) - Fr. 38 (the title says it's for the Panasonic GH4 but the description suggests it may work for many cameras).
* [Yelangu side handle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003154959234.html) - Fr. 31 (for use with a cage).

Note: Ulanzi and Yelangu are makes that are carried by many AliExpress stores and also have their own official stores (UURig is a Ulanzi brand - how it's supposed to be different to the main Ulanzi brand isn't clear).

Rather than a full cage it might be possible to use a cage handle and an L plate to attach a single handle to a camera. Oddly, there don't seem to be L plates designed specifically for this but perhaps one of these would work:

* [Minifocus L plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000479658654.html) - Fr. 17.
* [Minifocus L plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000416628222.html) - Fr. 12.
* [Minifocus L plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000008036605.html) - Fr. 9.
* [Bexin L plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001108433960.html) - Fr. 20.
* [Bexin L plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000586013850.html) - Fr. 9

Check that the side of the L plate that isn't attached to the underside of the camera is long enough and has suitably spaced holes for whatever handle you want to pair with it.

Side handle:

* [SmallRig mini side handle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001274263391.html) - Fr. 20.

Note: this page also has more expensive variants.

Full-size side handles are surprisingly expensive - the cheapest NATO rail compatible full-size handle on B&H is this [one](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1510748-REG/smallrig_hsn2427_aluminum_nato_side_handle.html) for $60.

Cage alternatives:

* [Steering wheel style camera holder](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000843181858.html) - some people recommend this broad steering wheel style for greater stability (the further out your hands are the better - you get a similar separation with a cage with two side handles).


* [Camvate universal half cage](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32904800304.html) - Fr. 46.
* [Camvate universal half cage with top handle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32904776495.html) - Fr. 66.

Somebody's Opinion has a nice review of this half cage [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL7_h724DuE) where he also discusses some of the add-ons he uses with it to make it easier to take the cage on and off.

It's not clear from the photos how the Camvate half cage attaches to the top of the camera but the product description notes that it comes with a cold shoe and presumably you screw down the top of the cage to this.

Note: Camvate is a brand carried by many stores (including B&H).

Random:

* [Selens top handle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000933528513.) - Fr. 18.
* [UURig R015 hot shoe monitor mount](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000144915243.html) - Fr. 14.
* [Selens hot monitor mount](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33002114582.html) - Fr. 25.

Note that the FW759 monitor, linked to up above, comes with such a hot shoe mount.
